> **A futuristic, holographic dashboard template featuring a cinematic boot sequence, interactive terminal, and real-time data visualization.**

Aether is a pure frontend "Glassmorphism" interface designed for developers who want a high-tech, sci-fi aesthetic without sacrificing performance. It simulates a complete operating system environment using standard web technologies.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🎬 Cinematic Boot Sequence**: Custom JS-driven initialization screen with simulated kernel loading logs.
- **🖥️ Interactive CLI Terminal**: Fully functional command-line interface. Type `help`, `scan`, or `reboot`.
- **🕸️ Neural Network Background**: HTML5 Canvas-based particle system that reacts to mouse movement physics.
- **📊 Real-Time Telemetry**: Integrated `Chart.js` with neon gradient fills for CPU/Memory simulation.
- **🔮 Glassmorphism UI**: Advanced CSS backdrop-filters, clip-paths, and dynamic lighting effects.
- **📱 Responsive Grid**: CSS Grid layout that adapts from desktop command centers to mobile viewports.
